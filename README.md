# Mobile FlashCards

React Native App for creating flashcards decks to quiz yourself.

Built with react native and the expo API.
Tested using a real Android device (Nexus 5x) using the expo App to load the JS code.

## Quickstart

1. Clone/Download the repo
2. cd into the project root and run `yarn install`
3. run `yarn start`

If you're using a real device with the expo App use the qr code reader from expo in order to load the FlashCards app, otherwise if you are using an emulator the app will open in the emulator.
